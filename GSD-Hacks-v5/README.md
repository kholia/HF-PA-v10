This version uses a GaN gate driver (MX1025D) and GSD pinout TO-252 package GaN FET. It also uses a cost-effective Chinese `coupled inductor`.

Update (16-August-2025): These JLCPCB assembled boards work great! This is the best digital amplifier design we have so far.

Works up to 75 MHz! Works without extra cooling at 12V to 15V drain. 20V drain needs extra cooling for heavy duty cycles.
